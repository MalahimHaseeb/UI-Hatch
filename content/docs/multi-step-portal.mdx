# Multi-Step Portal

Managing "Next" and "Previous" state across 5 different form sections is tedious. `MultiStepPortal` abstracts the state, the progress logic, and the navigation UI into one component.

## How To Use

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install

    <PackageInstall name={'multi-step-portal'} />
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Configuration

    Define your steps as an array of objects and pass them in.

    <DynamicCodeBlock lang={'tsx'} code={`
const steps = [
  { title: "Account", content: <AccountForm /> },
  { title: "Plan", content: <PlanSelector /> }
];

<MultiStepPortal 
  steps={steps} 
  onComplete={(data) => console.log(data)} 
/>
`}/>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Preview

<PreviewTabs
  component={<MultiStepPortalDemo />}
  code={`<MultiStepPortal steps={steps} onComplete={...} />`}
  name={'multi-step-portal'}
/>

## ✨ Key Features

- **Automated Progress**: Visual timeline updates as you move through steps.
- **State Isolation**: Each step is its own component; the portal handles the transition animation.
- **Flexible Content**: Steps can contain forms, images, or interactive selection tools.
- **Completion Hook**: A unified callback for when the user hits "Finish".

## 🛡️ Solves...
...the frequent need for complex on-boarding or multi-page wizards without polluting your parent components with `step === 1 ? ... : ...` logic.
