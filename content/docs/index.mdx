## 🧬 Built on shadcn/ui

UI Hatch works **in harmony with the official [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)** system. It adds polish, practical enhancements, and real-world utility components — while staying faithful to the ShadCN design principles.

You're still using the minimal, composable, and Tailwind-powered architecture — just with more options.
